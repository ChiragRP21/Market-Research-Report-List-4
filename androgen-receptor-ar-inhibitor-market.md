<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steroids</li><li>Nonsteroidal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibitors are compounds that target the AR to prevent its activation by androgens. Steroidal AR inhibitors are derived from testosterone and bind irreversibly to the receptor, while nonsteroidal inhibitors bind reversibly. Steroidal inhibitors include drugs like cyproterone acetate, while nonsteroidal inhibitors like enzalutamide have gained popularity due to their lower risk of side effects. Both types of inhibitors are used in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers like prostate cancer.</p></p>
