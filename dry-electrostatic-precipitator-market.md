<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Electrostatic Precipitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-Electrode</li><li>Moving-Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dry electrostatic precipitators are commonly categorized into two types: fixed-electrode and moving-electrode markets. In fixed-electrode precipitators, the electrodes remain stationary while the particles move towards them, creating an electric field that attracts and collects the particles. Moving-electrode precipitators, on the other hand, have electrodes that move to collect the particles. Both types are used in various industries to control air pollution by removing particulate matter and improving air quality.</p></p>
