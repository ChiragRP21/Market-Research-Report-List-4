<p><h1>Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents Market Size Reflecting a Forecast Till 2031: Market By Type, By Application and By Geography</h1></p><p><strong>Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents are medical devices used to treat blockages or strictures in the esophagus, which can be caused by conditions such as cancer, benign strictures, or other esophageal diseases. Plastic stents are typically made of silicone or polyethylene, while metal stents are usually made of nitinol or stainless steel. These stents work by holding open the narrowed or blocked part of the esophagus, allowing for improved swallowing and passage of food.</p><p>The Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.2% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of esophageal diseases and the rising demand for minimally invasive treatment options. Additionally, technological advancements in stent design and materials are also driving market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Plastic & Metal Esophageal Stents Market is the development of biodegradable stents, which eliminate the need for stent removal procedures. These stents gradually dissolve over time, reducing the risk of complications associated with long-term stent placement. Furthermore, the emergence of drug-eluting stents, which release medications to prevent tissue growth and prolong stent patency, is also expected to fuel market expansion in the coming years.</p></p>
