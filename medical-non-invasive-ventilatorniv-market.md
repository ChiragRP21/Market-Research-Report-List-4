<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Non invasive VentilatorNIV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilator</li><li>BiPAP Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the use of ventilatory support without the need for an invasive artificial airway. There are two main types of NIV ventilators - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) ventilator and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) ventilator. </p><p>CPAP ventilators deliver a constant level of positive airway pressure to keep the airways open during sleep, while BiPAP ventilators provide two levels of pressure - higher pressure during inhalation and lower pressure during exhalation. Both types of ventilators are commonly used in treating respiratory conditions such as sleep apnea and COPD.</p></p>
