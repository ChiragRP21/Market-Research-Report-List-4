<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coil Assisted Flow Diverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wide-neck</li><li>Narrow-neck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coil-assisted flow diverters are devices used to treat intracranial aneurysms by redirecting blood flow away from the aneurysm. They come in two main types: wide-neck and narrow-neck. Wide-neck flow diverters are suitable for aneurysms with a larger opening, allowing for effective diversion of blood flow. Narrow-neck flow diverters, on the other hand, are designed for aneurysms with a smaller opening, providing targeted treatment in more confined spaces. Both types of flow diverters offer treatment options for different anatomical variations of intracranial aneurysms.</p></p>
