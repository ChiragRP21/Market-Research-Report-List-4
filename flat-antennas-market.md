<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronically-steered Antenna</li><li>Mechanically-steered Antenna</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat antennas are divided into two main types: electronically-steered antennas and mechanically-steered antennas. Electronically-steered antennas use electronic circuits to steer the antenna beam in different directions without any physical movement, offering faster and more precise control. On the other hand, mechanically-steered antennas rely on physical movement to change the direction of the antenna beam, offering a simpler and more cost-effective solution. Both types of antennas have their own advantages and applications depending on the specific needs of the users.</p></p>
