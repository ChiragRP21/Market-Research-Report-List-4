<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polybutylene Oxygen Barrier Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polybutene-1 Homopolymer (PB-H)</li><li>Polybutene-1 Random Copolymer (PB-R)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polybutylene Oxygen Barrier Pipes are classified into two main types based on their chemical composition: Polybutene-1 Homopolymer (PB-H) and Polybutene-1 Random Copolymer (PB-R). PB-H pipes are made of pure polybutene-1, while PB-R pipes contain a combination of polybutene-1 and other copolymers. PB-H pipes have higher temperature resistance and better long-term stability, making them ideal for hot water applications. PB-R pipes, on the other hand, offer improved flexibility and impact resistance, making them suitable for a wider range of applications.</p></p>
