<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Mounted Gas Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall mounted gas boilers come in two main types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing boilers are more energy efficient as they utilize the heat from exhaust gases to preheat cold water before it enters the boiler, resulting in lower fuel consumption and emissions. On the other hand, non-condensing boilers do not have this feature and are typically less efficient. While condensing boilers tend to be more expensive upfront, they can lead to cost savings in the long run through lower energy bills.</p></p>
