<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotor Shaft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Process</li><li>Hot Isostatic Pressing Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Standard Process is a traditional method used in the manufacturing of rotor shafts where the material is simply forged or machined to shape. On the other hand, Hot Isostatic Pressing Process involves subjecting the material to high temperature and pressure in a sealed container to achieve a more uniform and dense structure. While the Standard Process is cost-effective and widely used, the Hot Isostatic Pressing Process results in a higher quality and more reliable rotor shaft, particularly in demanding applications.</p></p>
