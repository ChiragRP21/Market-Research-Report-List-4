<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interventional Balloon Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure Balloon</li><li>Low Pressure Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interventional Balloon Catheter market consists of two main types: High Pressure Balloon Catheters and Low Pressure Balloon Catheters. High Pressure Balloon Catheters are used for procedures that require higher inflation pressures to dilate blockages in blood vessels or other organs. These catheters are designed to withstand and deliver higher pressures. On the other hand, Low Pressure Balloon Catheters are used for delicate procedures where lower inflation pressures are required to avoid damaging sensitive tissues. Both types play a crucial role in various interventional procedures.</p></p>
