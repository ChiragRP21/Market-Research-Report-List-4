<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung FLuid Status Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lung Fluid Status Monitor market consists of two main types: Invasive and Non-invasive. Invasive monitors require insertion of a probe or catheter into the lung to directly measure fluid levels, providing more accurate but riskier results. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, use external sensors or imaging techniques to assess lung fluid status without the need for invasive procedures. While non-invasive monitors may be less precise, they offer a safer and more convenient option for monitoring lung fluid levels in patients.</p></p>
