<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-free Pressure Booster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-free pressure boosters are available in two main types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled pressure boosters use water to dissipate heat from the system, making them ideal for applications where water is readily available and efficient cooling is necessary. On the other hand, air cooled pressure boosters use air to cool the system, making them more suitable for applications where water usage is restricted or not feasible. Both types offer efficient and reliable performance in boosting pressure for various industrial applications.</p></p>
