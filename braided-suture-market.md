<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Braided Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Braided Suture</li><li>Non-absorbable Braided Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Braided sutures are available in two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable braided sutures are designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time, making them suitable for internal use where long-term support is not needed. Non-absorbable braided sutures, on the other hand, are made of materials that do not break down in the body and are used for procedures where long-term wound support is required. Both types offer different benefits and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and procedure.</p></p>
