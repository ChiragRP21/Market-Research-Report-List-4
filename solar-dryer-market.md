<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar dryers come in two main types: direct and indirect. Direct type solar dryers directly expose the food or material to be dried to the sun's rays, allowing for quick and efficient drying. On the other hand, indirect type solar dryers use a heat exchanger to transfer the heat from the sun to the drying chamber, providing a more controlled and gentle drying process. Both types of solar dryers have their advantages and are used in various industries for drying food, crops, and other materials.</p></p>
