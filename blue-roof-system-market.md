<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blue Roof System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Blue Roof System</li><li>Passive Blue Roof System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Blue Roof System market includes two main types: Active Blue Roof System and Passive Blue Roof System. Active systems use mechanical devices such as pumps to regulate the flow of water, while passive systems rely on gravity and natural drainage to manage water. Active systems are often more complex and require more maintenance, but they can offer greater control over water flow. Passive systems are simpler, with less mechanical components, making them easier to install and maintain. Both types of systems play crucial roles in managing stormwater runoff and reducing flooding risks.</p></p>
